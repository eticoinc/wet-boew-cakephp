# wet-boew-cakephp
Simple integration of wet-boew for CakePHP applications

**NOTE: Intended to be installed on a fresh CakePHP app.**

Right now the only theme implemented is the intranet theme.

**Usage:**
1. Install CakePHP App with Composer
2. Drop the files into the App's main folder, merging and replacing files
3. Update routes.php to set the default page to 'splash' instead of 'home'
